* Install
** ubuntu
Refer to: [^Manuel Ignacio López Quintero] 1. INSTALL TEX LIVE

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    sudo apt-get install texlive-full
#+END_EXAMPLE

1. INSTALL TEXMAKER

Now you need a text editor. I recommend using a specific editor for
LaTeX. There are many text editors for LaTeX on the Internet as Kile,
TeXworks, JLatexEditor, Gedit LaTeX Plugin, etc. My favorite text editor
for Latex is Texmaker. Texmaker is a cross-platform open source LaTeX
editor. To install it, go to the Ubuntu or Debian terminal and enter the
following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
    sudo apt-get install texmaker
#+END_SRC

1. CREATE YOUR FIRST DOCUMENT

To check that everything is working properly, create a LaTeX blank
document. Open Texmaker and click on File, New. Then write the following
code:

#+BEGIN_SRC latex
    \documentclass{article}
    \begin{document}
        Hello, world!
    \end{document}
#+END_SRC

** How to use Bibliography
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: how-to-use-bibliography
   :END:

1. Create a BibTeX bibliography file (a =bib= file) --- see
   [[https://texfaq.org/FAQ-buildbib]["creating a BibTeX file"]].

2. Use BibTeX [^latex-tutorial]

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     After creating the bibtex file, we have to tell LaTeX where to find
     our bibliographic database. For BibTeX this is not much different
     from printing the table of contents. We just need the commands
     /\bibliography/ which tells LaTeX the location of our .bib file and
     *
     \bibliographystyle*
     which selects one of various bibliographic styles.
   #+END_QUOTE

3. Compile your bibliography file use /Bibtex/ in Tex Maker or command
   line

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       bibtex myfile.tex
   #+END_SRC

   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
     Note that, at this stage, LaTeX isn't "resolving" any of the
     citations: at every =\cite= command, LaTeX will warn you of the
     undefined citation, and when the document finishes, there will be a
     further warning of undefined references.

     Referrered form: https://texfaq.org/FAQ-usebibtex

     Most editors will let you select, to run bibtex automatically on
     compilation.[^latex-tutorial]
   #+END_QUOTE

4. Compile tex file use pdflatex

5. An example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC latex
       \documentclass{article}
       \bibliographystyle{plain}
       \begin{document}
       Random citation \cite{kalman1960} embeddeed in text.

       \bibliography{biography.bib}
       \end{document}
   #+END_SRC

*** Printing single bib entry other than references
    :PROPERTIES:

    :END:

*Problem Description*:

The problems is described [^Printing single bib entry in a section other
than references]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  Traditionally we use \cite{} to print a list of cited references from
  a .bib file at the end of document.

  Apart from this i need to print one entry in a section (say above
  reference section).

  e.g. I need something like this

  Paper published

  1. A.dan, i am best, in: journal of.........

  References (list of cited references)

  1.A.dan, i am best, in: journal of.........
#+END_QUOTE

*Solutions*:

I took very long time to find the answer enventually, [^LaTeX: inline
BibTeX entries with the bibentry package]

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  In the introduction chapter of my PhD dissertation, I had to make a
  listing of my publications. The obvious brain dead way to achieve this
  is just typing everything manually in a list. But this feels just so
  wrong when you're already using BibTeX for managing references and
  bibliographical stuff. However, the traditional usage of BibTeX in
  LaTeX is to generate a full list of all references and put this in a
  dedicated section or chapter.

  With the bibentry package (which is part of the
  [[http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/ctanPackageInformation.py?id=natbib][natlib
  package]] actually) it is possible to put bibliographic entries
  anywhere in the text. As far as I know and experienced, the bibentry
  package is included in a default LaTeX setup, so you don't have to
  install something, just enable it in your document.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC latex
    \documentclass{article}

    \usepackage{bibentry}
    \nobibliography*

    \begin{document}

    \section{Introduction}

    Look ma, inline bibtex entries:

    \begin{itemize}
    \item \bibentry{michael}
    \item \bibentry{elvis}
    \end{itemize}

    \section{And now for something completely different}
    Lorem ipsum yada yada,
    also see \cite{britney},
    yada yada, and \cite{marilyn} too.

    \bibliographystyle{alpha}
    \bibliography{test_bibentry.bib}

    \end{document}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  The stuff that's important here: - =\usepackage{bibentry}=: duh. -
  =\nobibliography*=: tells bibentry to (re)use the bibliographic data
  from the standard BibTeX setup by
  =\bibliography{test_bibentry.bib}=. - =\bibentry{foo}=: an inline
  bibliographic entry will be put here.
